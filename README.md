## Description
This is my first attempt at a portfolio made using React and Material UI! Wrestling with the React framework was pretty rough at first but I definitely feel like I have more mastery over it now than I did before. The contact form is not completed yet but I have plans to hook up its functionality at a later date.

Here is a link to the deployed application:
https://charlottefrancis.github.io/my-portfolio/

Here is an image of the application in use:
